# 🩺 Heart Disease Prediction using Machine Learning

This project uses a Random Forest Classifier to predict the presence of heart disease based on 13 clinical attributes from the Cleveland Heart Disease dataset.

## 🔍 Features Used
- Age, Sex, Chest Pain Type (cp), Resting BP (trestbps), Cholesterol (chol)
- Fasting Blood Sugar (fbs), Resting ECG (restecg), Max Heart Rate (thalach)
- Exercise-Induced Angina (exang), ST Depression (oldpeak), Slope, Major Vessels (ca), Thalassemia (thal)

## 🎯 Output
- `0`: No disease
- `1`: Presence of heart disease

## 📊 Model
- Algorithm: Random Forest
- Accuracy: ~88%
- Evaluation: Precision, Recall, F1-score

## 🚀 How to Run
Open the notebook in Google Colab and run the cells.

## 📁 Dataset
- Format: CSV
- Source: UCI Machine Learning Repository (Cleveland Heart Disease)
